Great! Since you've got the secrets working and the app running on Replit, here’s how to **deploy** it so anyone can access and use it — even if they don’t have a Replit account.

---

## ✅ 1. **Make Your Replit App Publicly Accessible**

### 🔹 Option 1: Share the Replit Web App Link (Easiest)

1. **Click the “Deploy” button** at the top-right.
2. Choose **"Static" or "Web Server"** (depending on your app type).
3. After deploying, you'll get a **public URL** (e.g., `https://your-app-name.username.repl.co`).
4. **Share this URL** with anyone — they can open it like a normal website.

## ✅ 2. **Let Others Access It Without Editing**

* Go to **“Invite”** (top bar).
* Click **“Link Settings”** and set:

  * Access: `Can view` only (not edit).
  * Make sure the **project itself is public** or the link is enabled.

## ✅ 3. **Optional: Download Feature (if needed)**

If you want people to **download something from your app** (like movie details, video files, etc.), you’ll need to:

* Add a **“Download” button** to your app using HTML + Flask (or Streamlit).
* Serve files using `send_file` in Flask:

```python
from flask import send_file

@app.route('/download')
def download():
    return send_file('path/to/file.mp4', as_attachment=True)
```

Let me know what you want users to download (a video, text file, etc.), and I’ll write the code.

## ✅ 4. **Custom Domain (Optional)**

If you want a cleaner link like `moviefinder.com`:

* Buy a domain (e.g., from Namecheap or Google Domains).
* Point it to your Replit URL using a CNAME record.
* Replit supports custom domains under **Deploy > Domain**.

### ✅ Next: Want Help Packaging This as an App or APK?

If you want users to download an **Android App (.apk)** or a **Windows App (.exe)**, I can help guide you through that too — just say the word.

---

Let me know if your app is:

* built with **Flask**, **Streamlit**, or **something else**
* supposed to **upload images/videos, detect movies, and return results**

I’ll give you exact next steps based on your setup.
